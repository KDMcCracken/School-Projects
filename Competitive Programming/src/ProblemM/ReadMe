Description:
      -First line is the number of cases
      -Each line thereafter has two numbers. The first is V and the second is E

Objective:
    Find the number of faces in the defined polyhedron
        Equation: x = V - E + F = 2
            V represents number of vertices
            E represents number of edges
            F represents number of faces

 Expected Output for input case:
   6
   4
